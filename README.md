## Chennai Transit Network
This is a comprehensive map of Chennai's Transit system.

The map includes Chennai Metro, Chennai Suburban, Chennai MRTS lines. I've also included the important bus stops.

The map is quite big, and text size, color are tailored to view zoomed in. The JPEG and PDF file in this repo are of great quality, and the intricate details of the map can be viewed by zooming in. but if the map is shared as JPED in social media, it might lose quality, and the user wont be able to read it's content properly. I suggest sdharing this link to whoever needs to view the map, as this has source quality.

If you want to reproduce, or use this map for commercial purpose, please reach out to karthikeyan14june@gmail.com
If you want to use this for personal use, please feel free to go ahead and use it.

Thanks!
